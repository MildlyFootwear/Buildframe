## Buildframe

Buildframe is an indevelopment open source theory crafting utility for Warframe.  

Its intent is to make it easy to create presets and custom effect templates representing ingame effects, making it easy to customize and combine them to calculate and display derived stats.
Reload time, sustained DPS, burst DPS, average critical hit, and more can be calculated with any number of combinations of weapon mods, warframe arcanes, abilities, and more.


### How To Use

Several editors have been built in to facilitate the creation of weapons, mods, arcanes, and other effects. Some instructions have been included in the appropriate editors but to get the best use out of them you will need at least some understanding of how various effects overlay onto eachother.
Most current and future weapons should be able to be roughly represented, as well as current and future mods, arcanes, and warframe abilities.  
A reasonable amount of weapons, firemodes, arcanes, mods, and abilities have been included and can be viewed in the editors to get an understanding of how to create your own.  

Several effects have been hardcoded, such as the arcane Secondary Enervate as well as the incarnon perk Devouring/Devastating Attrition found on the Phenmor, Laetum, and Felarx. These can still be manually replicated on the users end, however these should be a more accurate representation of their effects ingame as of the time of writing.
